# Hayden Badger - Seldom

Hello! I'm Hayden, a game developer and Bevy plugin author. This portfolio showcases
my more notable projects. First, here's a short introduction.

I've used various tools to make games since 2008, but I didn't learn Rust until 2019,
when I was in college. It quickly became my favorite language, so I started many projects
in it. I used Amethyst on and off, until I discovered Bevy 0.4 in December 2020. I used it
on and off, until September 2021, when I became less busy with school and work, and I started
working on my Bevy projects very actively. This active work continues to today.

In May 2022, I earned my Software Engineering B.S. from Arizona State University with a 4.00 GPA.
Since then, I've been living off the money I saved up and working on various projects in Bevy.
After adding Rhai scripting to one of my games, I realized some of my work could be useful
to other developers. Since then, I've been writing my games in a decoupled way,
so I can pull out a piece of it and release it as a plugin. I've released 5 Bevy-related
crates so far, and I currently have 3 more in the works.
